    "- **leaning curves** are the plots of loss on the training and on the validation set, epoch by epoch.\n",
    "- the training loss will go down when the mode learns signal or when it learns noise\n",
    "- we have to mkae a trade: we can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. \n",
    "    - as long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease\n",
    "- this trade-off indicates that there can be two problems that occur when training model: **not enough signal** or **too much noise**.\n",
    "    - **Underfitting** the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model hasn't learned enough *signal*\n",
